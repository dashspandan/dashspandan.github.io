I am a Postdocoral Researcher at the Institute de Physique du Globe du Paris (with a contract at Universite Paris Cite), where I work in the group of Dr. Sebastien Charnoz. I work on modelling magma oceans. My aim is to try and find potential atmospheric signatures indicating the presence of magma oceans at the base of atmospheres in volatile rich sub-Neptunes, which can be discerened in teh future using data from both space-based low-resolution and ground-based high resolution spectrographs. 

I was previously a PhD student in Physics in the Astronomy and Astrophysics group at University of Warwick. My PhD supervisor was Dr. Matteo Brogi (currently at University of Turin). My PhD research involved working with high-resolution (R>25,000) spectroscopic transmission and emission observations of exoplanet atmospheres using my pipeline Upamana. I also work on simulation of transmission and emission observations of exoplanet atmospheres using my pipeline Ratri, at high spectral resolution using current and next generation ground-based spectrographs, in order to quantify the observability of specific molecular signatures.

I have a Master of Science in Astronomy (Research) degree from Leiden University, The Netherlands. I completed my 4 year Bachelor of Science in Physics from Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in Karnataka, India. I completed my Senior Secondary (High) schooling from DAV Public School, Chandrasekharpur, Bhubaneswar, India and my Secondary Schooling (Matriculation) from Modern Public School, Meghadambaru, Kuruda, Balasore.

My hobbies include reading books, watching science fiction movies, anime and TV series. I’m also a comics and manga enthusiast and love depictions of kaiju and giant robots in media.

Eventually, I would like to do independent research in Astrobiology, an area I’ve had an interest for since a long time. I also plan to work on science popularization and outreach and aim to help a generation of new astronomers, astrobiologists and planetary scientists come up in my country. Please feel free to contact me if you need some stuff answered!
