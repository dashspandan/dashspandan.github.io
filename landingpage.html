I am a PhD student in Physics in the Astronomy and Astrophysics group at University of Warwick. My supervisor is Dr. Matteo Brogi. My research involves working with high resolution spectroscopic data of exoplanet atmospheres and simulation of observations of atmospheric biomarkers that could be observed using the next generation of telescopes.

I have a Master of Science in Astronomy (Research) degree from Leiden University, The Netherlands. I completed my 4 year Bachelor of Science in Physics from Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in Karnataka, India. I completed my Senior Secondary (High) schooling from DAV Public School, Chandrasekharpur, Bhubaneswar, India and my Secondary Schooling (Matriculation) from Modern Public School, Meghadambaru, Kuruda, Balasore.

My hobbies include reading books, watching science fiction movies, anime and TV series. I’m also a comics enthusiast and would have had more comics in my collection if I was not a researcher.

Eventually, I’d like to do independent research in Astrobiology, an area I’ve had an interest for since a long time. I also plan to work on science popularization and outreach and aim to help a generation of new astronomers, astrobiologists and planetary scientists come up in my country. Please feel free to contact me if you need some stuff answered!
